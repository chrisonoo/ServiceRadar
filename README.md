## About Me

Hello, I'm Krzysztof, but feel free to call me Chris. I'm a budding full-stack programmer with a special focus on **.NET** and **SQL**. Passionate about problem-solving, I enjoy crafting efficient **backend** and **frontend** solutions.

As an emerging software developer, I'm keen to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I'm excited to bring my life and professional experience, providing a unique perspective to software development tasks. Eager to commence my journey in the industry, I am **actively seeking employment opportunities** where I can continue to grow and create.
